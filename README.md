Quiet Password
====================

Description
--------------------------------
Quiet Password is a Chrome extension that makes password fields not echo any characters. Feel more at ease
when typing in passwords. This extension is aimed at security buffs, people doing computer presentations
and demos, and the paranoid. :-)

Usage
--------------------------------
Go to any website with a password input field and the extension covers it with a safe password field.
The cover is light orange-red if the underlying password field is empty and light green when there are characters
underneath.
